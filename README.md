 This project demonstrates how to use a tilt switch to create a dynamic text animation on a 16x2 LCD screen. When the device is tilted, the text "falls" to the right, simulating a gravity-like effect. When the device is returned to its stable position, the text smoothly "falls" back to its original position.
